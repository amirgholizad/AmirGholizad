## 🚀 Projects

### CRUD Web App
- Developed a CRUD web application using FastAPI and PostgreSQL.
- Deployed on an EC2 instance, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- Implemented Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic efficiently.
- Utilized Docker for containerization, simplifying the deployment process.

### Exploring Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Fluid Flow Analysis
- Investigated fluid behavior using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) techniques.
- Focused on analyzing the vorticity field of a two-dimensional flow past a cylinder at Reynolds number Re = 200.
- Applied a combination of POD and DMD methods to reduce dimension and predict future flow modes.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimators of Weibull and Uniform Distributions
- Utilized R programming language to estimate the parameters of Weibull and Uniform probability distributions using Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs).

### IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis
- Implemented a Sequential model in Keras with 3 Dense layers and Sigmoid Activation functions.
- Compiled the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
- Achieved 85% precision on testing set in classifying reviews into “positive” and “negative” groups.
